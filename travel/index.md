            Princeton University is a world-class venue. Whether you are coming by plane, train, or car, it has never been easier. Princeton is just a brief train ride from both NYC and Philadelphia, with easy access to Newark Liberty International Airport. There’s plenty of on site parking, too!
        </p>

            The two main buildings with rooms reserved at Princeton are Frist Campus Center and McCosh Hall. The buildings are a one minute walk from each other, and boast a variety of lecture halls, seminar rooms, and multipurpose areas. The newly renovated McCosh 50 room is the largest classroom in Princeton University and will be the site of the NESS keynote address.
